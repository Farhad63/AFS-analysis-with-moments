## Allele Frequency Spectrum (AFS) analysis of pairs of populations using *Moments*

*Moments* is AFS analysis method superficially similar to *dadi* but operating on different math (ordinary differential equations rather than diffusion approximation) It is considerably faster than *dadi*, handles up to five populations simultaneously, has easy functions for bootstrapping and estimating parameter uncertainties, and plots cartoons of inferred demographic scenarios.

This collection of command-line scrips is to run basic pairwise analysis of 
population subdivision using *Moments*, without the need to recode python scripts. 

See **moments_scripts_README.txt** for instructions.
